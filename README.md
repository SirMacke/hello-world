# hello-world

Hey Developers and Humans!

Max here, I'm a modern, up-to-date web developer using FreeCodeCamp to learn HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
Recently I finished "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)" and moving on to "Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification (300 hours)".

My goal here with you guys is to improve as a web developer and start working as a freelancer.

Thx for reading this!
